# Digitimate
Service for confirming mobile numbers

## Note: We are sunsetting Digitimate on Monday, July 9, 2018.

On July 9, 2018, we are sunsetting Digitimate. This is over 180 days from the announcement (on January 9), which we believe is ample advance notice for developers to find time to gracefully migrate off of Digitimate.

**Developers who are already using Digitimate:** We will help you migrate to another SMS confirmation service by letting you export the data associated with the developer email address you used with Digitimate.

You either can run Digitimate yourself (the code will stay open-source on July 9), which requires Node.js, RethinkDB, and a Twilio account, or you can use another SMS confirmation service, such as building your own that connects to an SMS service like Twilio.

**Developers who aren't already using Digitimate:** We recommend that you choose another service today so you don't have to migrate so soon.

**Data policy:** After July 9, the Digitimate service will no longer be online. We may continue to allow developers to export data associated with their developer email addresses for a couple of weeks afterwards. After that, we'll turn off Digitimate and terminate the Node.js servers, RethinkDB server, and disks used by those servers.
